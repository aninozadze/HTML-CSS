        <h2>Most of our lives are structured around the
            people and events around us, the goal of this
            experience is to find time for yourself. 
            Breathing, introspection, and meditation
            will be a main focus of our time together
            with Iwayama Tomomi, the founder of Flying
            Monk in Odawara, Japan. Past participants
            have included individuals and even companies 
            looking to find ways to relieve stress and 
            apply the teachings of mindfulness to the daily lives.
            At the end we encourage open discussion and questions.
